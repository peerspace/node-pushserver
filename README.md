# Push Server

Duplicate of https://github.com/peerspace/node-pushserver (PUBLIC - DO NOT USE)

After duplication, the main dependency (`npm install apn`) was upgraded, which required a rewrite of APNPusher.

Since the peerspace version is now significantly different than the public version published by SmileSA - we duplicated our fork of their repo and made it private.

The other major change from the original, is that the web interface bundled with the server has been removed.
